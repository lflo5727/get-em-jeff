This is a simple extension for Firefox that plays Bo Burnham's Bezos I when you open the checkout page on Amazon.

## Permissions
Most browsers don't let audio  autoplay be default anymore (for obvious reasons), so to use this you'll need to whitelist Amazon. [Follow Firefox's Docs](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/block-autoplay).
